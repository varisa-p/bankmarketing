This repository contains Python code for the data analysis and machine learning of bank marketing data. 
The code includes various tasks, such as identifying missing values, calculating descriptive statistics, analysing associations 
using Pearson correlation, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square tests. 
It involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers will subscribe to a bank campaign.

The dataset used for this analysis is from Moro, S., Rita, P., and Cortez, P. (2012). Bank Marketing. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5K306.
